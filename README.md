  This is a playground repo.

I plan to brush up on skills and try out new things. Specifically:

# Gatsby 
This is a Gatsby site. 

# Sass 
Seems like a really efficient way of managing css.

# React
I've learned the fundamentals of React, but want to keep my skills fresh.

# React Bootstrap 
To get some slick looking boilerplate components.
